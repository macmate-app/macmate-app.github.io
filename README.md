I am creating a website to sell Mac apps. All the apps are listed in the Mac App Store.
My apps are mainly for productivity. Most of the users are developers or designers. Some of them are for general users.
All the apps are professionally built, not just small or hobby projects.
Please write me some marketing text for my website. I will use it to promote my apps.

## Todo

- finish home page
- finish apps page
- add a blog section
